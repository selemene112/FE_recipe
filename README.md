Some of the advantages of this feature are:
1. Search Menu can be done by selecting several items based on title or ingredients
2. The Like value can change dynamically depending on the number of users who like

This is a comment feature that uses WEB SOCKET to carry out real-time data transactions

In the future, I plan to develop a project to handle payments so that they can be connected directly to the original banking system
If you are interested in this project further, you can contact me on some of my social media
